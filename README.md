# RespawnCountdown for SynapseSL

A fairly simple yet incredibly powerful Respawn Countdown for SynapseSL. Featuring reliability built in natively, 
nearly guaranteed non-interference with other plugins (*) and probably one of the sleekest designs out there.

## Installation

First, grab yourself a copy of Synapse. Then throw this bad boy into your plugins and you should be good to go!

## Help! XYZ is not working!

Stay calm. Check whether Synapse is working properly, whether the configs are corrupt or not, and only if you can't figure it
out yourself, ask for help on the Synapse discord or open a new issue.

## I want to contribute!
Great! Fork it and push your changes. Then create a pull request and I'll look at it :)
